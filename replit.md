## Deployment Strategy

### Build Process
1. **Frontend Build**: Vite builds React app to `dist/public`
2. **Backend Build**: esbuild bundles server code to `dist/index.js`
3. **Database**: Drizzle push for schema deployment

### Environment Configuration
- **Database**: `DATABASE_URL` environment variable required
- **Development**: NODE_ENV=development for dev server
- **Production**: NODE_ENV=production for optimized builds

### Hosting Requirements
- **Node.js**: ES modules support required
- **PostgreSQL**: Compatible database (Neon Database recommended)
- **Static Assets**: Frontend files served from `dist/public`

### Development Workflow
- **Dev Server**: `npm run dev` starts both frontend and backend with hot reload
- **Database Sync**: `npm run db:push` applies schema changes
- **Type Checking**: `npm run check` validates TypeScript
